## History

-   I started teaching a class on sports analytics in Spring 2018.
-   I was contacted about writing a book^[Nonparametric Statistics] at around that same time.
-   My colleague, Andrew Urbaczewski, and I starting talking about writing a sports analytics book in mid- to late-2020 and signed an agreement in 2021.
-   It came out in 2024.^[Don't ask my hourly rate at this point.]
